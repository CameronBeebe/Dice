Simulating a simple Dice game (called "Dice").  

Future development would make interface for artificial agents to play (and learn to play).

TO DO:

1.  Need to implement option to hold without continuing to roll.  

2.  Create verbosity logic. Maybe verbose = 0, 1, or 2, where 1 shows faces and 2 shows faces and die objects in memory.

3.  Make player_take_turn while loop logic more elegant...?

4.  Compactify all lengthy list comprehensions?  Maybe use type()==Dice_Game.Die?
